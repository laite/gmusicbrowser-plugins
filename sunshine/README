'Sunshine' is a plugin for gmusicbrowser. I have only tested it with gmb 1.1.7, so feel free to report any problems.

** How to install:

1) Copy sunshine.pm to /usr/share/gmusicbrowser/plugins
2) Copy *.png to /usr/share/gmusicbrowser/pix
3) Restart gmb
4) Enable sunshine from Preferences -> Plugins
** How to use:

Sunshine has two main features: it allows user to listen to music before going to sleep and automatically start playback in the morning.

First section of plugin preferences concerns, as it's title suggests, going to sleep, and second section is for waking up. Options should be pretty self-explanatory (I think). 'Repeat alarm' remembers current alarm setting and automatically places a new alarm to next suitable time, should work even if gmb is closed and restarted.

Third section has info about currently ongoing things - don't be alarmed if nothing changes when you start countdown/alarm, it refreshes only when you exit and re-enter plugins preferences (for example selecting another plugin and returning).

** Advanced

You can put custom buttons to your layout for starting sleep-mode, alarm or both. Possible buttons you can add are named: SunshineSleep, SunshineSleepAlarm and SunshineAlarm, with images 'plugin-sleep.png', 'plugin-sleep-alarm.png' and 'plugin-alarm.png' respectively.
