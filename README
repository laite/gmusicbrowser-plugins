All files in laite/gmusicbrowser_plugins are unofficial plugins for gmusicbrowser. There is no guarantee that they'll work at all. It's recommended to always use latest version of gmusicbrowser with my plugins, preferrable the version found in http://github.com/squentin/gmusicbrowser.
Any questions or suggestions regarding these plugins should be addressed to me (laite) either at #gmusicbrowser (freenode), in gmusicbrowser forums or by mail: laite@gmx.com
