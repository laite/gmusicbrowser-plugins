# Gmusicbrowser-plugins

These are getting fairly old (as are we all), and unfortunately I won't be able to maintain/update the plugins any longer.

They may and probably will break (see [https://github.com/mklinga/gmusicbrowser-plugins/issues/1](https://github.com/mklinga/gmusicbrowser-plugins/issues/1)). 

If you feel like you have fixed something, please let me know (pull requests are always nice).

Thanks for everything, especially to Squentin for his fantastic gmusicbrowser.
