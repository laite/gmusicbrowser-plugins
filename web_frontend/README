This is *not* a plugin as such, it's something small I put together in one
evening after becoming so lazy I couldn't be bothered to get up from the couch
in order to play/pause gmusicbrowser.. Now all I need is my tablet and web
browser pointed to my computer.

:: Requirements: 

php
php-dbus extension http://pecl.php.net/package/DBus
(I installed it through php-pear, with: sudo pecl install dbus-beta)

:: Installation

After installing php-dbus and cloning these files it's (hopefully) a simple
matter of running server. Note that you must run it as local user, so apache
(and such) are usually out of question. Luckily, modern php allows itself to be
used as server (once again, note! You probably shouldn't do this if your
computer is accessible from outside world! This is very likely not a secure
script).

So, let's launch php server (in folder your files are):
php -S 192.168.11.4:8003

Obviously, change your ip and port you wish to use accordingly.

If everything went well, you can now surf to http://192.168.11.4:8003/dbus.php
and play/pause from your respective couch!
