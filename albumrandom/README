'Albumrandom' is a plugin for gmusicbrowser. I have only tested it with gmb 1.1.7, so feel free to report any problems.

You need Gtk2::Notify for this plugin, since it's used by popup notifications.


** How to install:

1) Copy 'albumrandom.pm' to /usr/share/gmusicbrowser/plugins
2) Copy 'plugin-albumrandom.png' and 'plugin-albumrandom-on.png' to /usr/share/gmusicbrowser/pix

If layout button doesn't appear automatically (you need to have Extrabuttons in your layout):
*) Add item called Albumrandom to your layout

3) Restart gmb
4) Enable Albumrandom from Preferences -> Plugins


** How to use:

Albumrandom mainly operates through its layout button:
	* left click on the button generates random album and enqueues the first song.
	* middle click forces re-calculate to DB
	* right click switches Infinite Mode ON/OFF

** How it works?

Albumrandom calculates average randoms on your albums based on currently selected 'weighted random' mode. If you have selected 'shuffle' or some 'straight play' mode instead of weighted random it handles all albums' propabilities as equal and calculates accordingly.

** Options

* Write statistics: Keeps helpful log 'albumrandom2.log' and saves it in your gmb config directory.

* Infinite Mode: Selects new album with same settings after current album is played without user having to interrupt. If at any point user changes music manually, infinite mode is automatically cut off.

* Require all tracks of album in filter: If your current filter or playlist doesn't contain all songs from album, it won't get selected while this option is on

* Select only from top Y albums: My personal favourite! No need to listen all those horrible records, just the stuff you like - with weighted random. Top albums are obviously measured by their propability according to your random settings.

* Re-calculate DB after X hours': If checked, plugin will refresh DB every X hours (only when albumrandom is 'on', aka either generating album or Infinite Mode playing). If this is selected, Albumrandom will keep your DB cached between sessions and doesn't update it in the start of gmb session if not enough time has passed since the last update.

* Show notifications: Shows notifications

* Remember and restore playmode: Takes note of your current playmode when calculating DB (first time, forced or as a timed update) and returns to that after Albumrandom is shut down. This can happen either by setting Infinite Mode OFF or manually selecting track outside Albumrandoms current album.

* Multiple random: You can switch amount of albums and playlist, where they are stored (Please note that there is a bug in gmb which requires you to close and re-open playlist to see its contents! Fixed in gmusicbrowsers GIT 2011-07-13)

* Dont ask me what to do when DB calculated with different playmode: By default, Albumrandom asks if you wish to calculate DB again or use old calculations. You can remove that dialog by setting default value here.

* Tweakmode: [ADVANCED SETTING] This tweaks albums' random value by formula (original_value^Tweak_power)*(Tweak_multiply/100) = tweaked_value. If you are not too mindful of your random modes distribution/deviation you shouldn't need to enable this.

** Important to note

- Albumrandom relies on you having your tags in order! Artist, Album and Tracknumber are needed in order to use plugin as intended.
- First calculation of DB might take a long time (it takes ~7 seconds for my 37000 tracks), so please be patient before giving up.
- Unlike in the old version, there is no 'select source' option (or any context menu, for that matter). Albumrandom now automatically uses your current playlist/filter from gmb.
- Be mindful of your current playmode (weighted random/straight mode)  when updating DB - it's very possible to calculate DB with wrong setting since there is no confirmation. Remember that you can always re-calculate DB by middle-clicking layout button after setting wanted playmode.
- If you want to know what plugin has done, see log in the preferences. It's quite verbose.

** Caching

Older version of albumrandom had many options for caching, but I found them very ugly and unpractical, so I simplified the whole process. You now have to calculate the whole library when starting to use Albumrandom, and it can automatically refresh this at even intervals  using "re-calculate DB after X hours" - option. Note, that played albums get updated instantly.

Addition: When 'interval re-calculating' is ON, DB is kept cached even between sessions and only updated when enough time has passed.

** Unknown behaviour

Please report any problems and/or suggestions for features.
